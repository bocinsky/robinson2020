## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:  

- [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document for the manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version, `paper.html`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures and tables in this file).
- [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.  
- [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other illustrations

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on [binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/people3k/robinson2020/master?urlpath=rstudio) to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses (rocker-project.org)[rocker-project.org Docker] images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: [master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping, open the `Proj` file in RStudio, and run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). Then open `paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`.

Or, simply install straight from Github:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("people3k/robinson2020")
```
