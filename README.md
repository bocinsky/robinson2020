## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

  - [:file\_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for the manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and
    tables generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `paper.html`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
    and tables in this file).
  - [:file\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.  
  - [:file\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
    illustrations

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/people3k/robinson2020/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses
(rocker-project.org)\[rocker-project.org Docker\] images to ensure a
consistent and reproducible computational environment. These Docker
images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping, open the `Proj` file
in RStudio, and run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the
packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the
[DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). Then open `paper.Rmd` and knit to
produce the `paper.docx`.

Or, simply install straight from Github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("people3k/robinson2020")
```
